## Project Overview

Within repository, you can find design ideas and materials that reflect the core values of AL'NE Natural Cosmetics â€“ authenticity, sustainability, and sophistication. These materials are still in the conceptual phase and were created to represent the brandâ€™s vision across various formats. Although they are not finalized, you can see how these designs might look in real-life settings, as shown in the mockups (located in the folder) and 3D model.



## Included Assets

As part of the Nousish Vera branding project, various visual elements were created to represent the product line and brand identity. The main components include:

- Billboard Visuals â€“ designed visuals of billboard advertisements were created to show how the brandâ€™s products could appear in real outdoor advertising settings. These designs help express the brand identity in a large-format medium.

- Mockups â€“ realistic mockups of promotional materials were used to simulate how the final visuals would appear in real-world contexts.

- Sticker Designs â€“ branded sticker visuals were developed to align with the overall visual identity of the brand. 


## Tools Used
The following tools were used to create and refine the visual materials in this project:

- Adobe Photoshop â€“ the primary software used for designing all visual elements. It was used for image editing, layout design, typography, and preparing the final assets for presentation.

- Freepik â€“ a platform used to source professional PSD mockups. These mockups were used to showcase how the designs, such as billboards and stickers, would appear in real promotional settings. Utilizing these resources allowed for a realistic visualization of the brand's final look.
