## Project Overview

Within repository, you can find design ideas and materials that reflect the core values of AL'NE Natural Cosmetics â€“ authenticity, sustainability, and sophistication. These materials are still in the conceptual phase and were created to represent the brandâ€™s vision across various formats. Although they are not finalized, you can see how these designs might look in real-life settings, as shown in the mockups (located in the folder) and 3D model.

- Mockups â€“ realistic mockups of promotional materials were used to simulate how the final visuals would appear in real-world contexts.

- Sticker Designs â€“ branded sticker visuals were developed to align with the overall visual identity of the brand.
