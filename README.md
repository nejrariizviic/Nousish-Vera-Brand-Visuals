## Project Overview

Nousish Vera is a conceptual brand in the natural cosmetics and personal care domain, emphasizing elegance, simplicity, and a contemporary visual expression. The visual solutions in this project are designed to convey messages of purity, clarity, and a modern approach to branding.

The main goal of the project was to develop a distinctive visual identity that could be applied across various communication channels â€” from outdoor advertising to product packaging. The design was developed with attention to visual harmony through:

- consistent selection of typography and spacing, ensuring readability and a clean appearance

- a minimalist yet striking style that highlights the key product elements

- diverse use of colors tailored to the specifics of individual campaigns and products, allowing freshness and variety in the brandâ€™s visual experience

As a result, promotional billboards were created to demonstrate how the products fit into large-scale advertising contexts, realistic mockups simulate the application of designs in real environments, and sticker designs intended for packaging were developed.



## Included Assets

As part of the Nousish Vera branding project, various visual elements were created to represent the product line and brand identity. The main components include:

- Billboard Visuals â€“ designed visuals of billboard advertisements were created to show how the brandâ€™s products could appear in real outdoor advertising settings. These designs help express the brand identity in a large-format medium.

- Mockups â€“ realistic mockups of promotional materials were used to simulate how the final visuals would appear in real-world contexts.

- Sticker Designs â€“ branded sticker visuals were developed to align with the overall visual identity of the brand. 


## Tools Used

The following tools were used to create and refine the visual materials in this project:

- Adobe Photoshop â€“ the primary software used for designing all visual elements.

- Freepik â€“ a resource platform for high-quality PSD mockups, used to demonstrate how the final designs would be applied in actual marketing environments.
